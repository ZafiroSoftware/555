# 555
CRUD Code Generator. Paint the capture window and 555 generates your code

This is the initial code to paint your <b>CRUD</b> screens and 555 generate all the code. At this time only paints and save/load the definition in a json file. All the properties are self explanatories.

Please send me any comment.

Best regards,
Arístides
